It provides real-time lyric synchronization across multiple transparent output displays, making it ideal for church services, concerts, and live streaming setups where lyrics need to be displayed both in-house and for broadcast.

## Key Features

### Multi-Output Display System

- **Browser Source Compatible**: Works seamlessly with popular streaming software

### Advanced Lyric Management
- **Smart Text Processing**: Automatic formatting for cleaning up lyric files
- **Translation Support**: Displays translation lines where available (lines wrapped in brackets below main lyric line) 
- **Live Editing Canvas**: Built-in editor with formatting tools and auto-cleanup
- **Search & Navigation**: Advanced search with match highlighting and keyboard navigation

### Comprehensive Styling Engine
- **13 Professional Fonts**: 13 pro fonts from Google Fonts
- **Typography Controls**: Bold, italic, underline, and all-caps options
- **Color Customization**: Independent font and drop shadow colors
- **Background Controls**: Adjustable opacity and color settings
- **Padding Adjustments**: X/Y margin controls for proper padding control
- **Full Screen Mode**:    Fill colour/media background options for full screen lyrics display

### Professional Features
- **Auto-Updates**: Seamless background updates via GitHub releases
- **Dark Mode**: System-integrated dark/light theme switching
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Full menu-driven workflow
- **Secondary Controllers**: Authorize mobile/web devices with a 6-digit join code so remote operators can trigger lines and submit lyric drafts (desktop approval required)
- **Cross-Platform**: Windows, macOS, and Linux support
- **Socket.io Backend**: Secure and reliable real-time communication

## Installation

### Pre-built Releases (Recommended)
1. Download the latest release by [clicking Here](https://mega.nz/file/4mxRlawQ#JkBaRM5mN58cwrr33TPPA32pZohRyncq2dJPz7yxmgY)
2. Run the installer for your platform
3. Launch LyricDisplay

### Development Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PeterAlaks/lyric-display-app.git
cd lyric-display-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development mode
npm run electron-dev

# Build for production
npm run electron-pack
```

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Loading Lyrics
- **File Menu → Load Lyrics File** (Ctrl/Cmd+O)
- **Drag & Drop**: Drop .txt files directly into the main panel
- **New Song Canvas**: Create and format lyrics from scratch (Ctrl/Cmd+N)

### 2. Setting Up Outputs
1. Configure **Output 1** and **Output 2** settings independently
2. Use **File Menu → Preview Output 1/2** (Ctrl/Cmd+1/2) to open and preview display outputs in windows
3. Toggle **Display Output** switch to control visibility

### 3. Live Operation
- Click lyric lines to select and display them
- Use search bar to quickly find specific lyrics
- Navigate matches with Shift+Up/Down arrows
- Toggle output on/off with the main switch

### 4. Secondary Controllers (Optional)
- In the desktop app, open `File > Connect Mobile Controller` or tap the shield icon to view the QR code and current 6-digit join code (the code refreshes when the app restarts)
- On a phone or tablet on the same network, scan the QR code or visit `http://<control-pc-ip>:4000/?client=mobile`, then enter the join code to pair
- Paired controllers load the mobile layout where they can trigger lyric lines, toggle outputs, run manual sync, and submit lyric drafts for approval

## File Format

LyricDisplay accepts plain text (.txt) and lyrics (.lrc) files with the following format:

```
First verse line
[Translation or alternative text]

Second verse line
Another line without translation

Chorus line one
[Chorus translation]
```

**Formatting Rules:**

- Bracketed lines `[like this]`, `(this)` or `{this}` are treated as translation lines
- Two consecutive lines where the second is bracketed will be grouped
- Auto cleanup removes periods and other special characters, capitalizes first letter of words like God, Jesus, etc.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **React 18** with React Router for SPA navigation
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive styling
- **Radix UI** components for accessibility
- **Zustand** for state management with persistence
- **Lucide React** for modern iconography

### Backend Infrastructure
- **Express.js** server for static file serving
- **Socket.io** for real-time WebSocket communication
- **Node.js** child processes for backend management

### Desktop Integration
- **Electron 37** for cross-platform desktop application
- **Auto-updater** with GitHub releases integration
- **Native menus** with keyboard shortcuts
- **System theme** synchronization

## Configuration
