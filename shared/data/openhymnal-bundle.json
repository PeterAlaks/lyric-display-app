The wrath and stripes are hard to bear, But by Thy Passion men shall share The fruit of Thy salvation.\"",

The Father offers up His Son! The Son, content, descendeth! O Love, how strong Thou art to save! Thou beddest Him within the grave Whose word the mountains rendeth.",

Yea, Thou shalt be my Beaconlight, To guide me safe through death's dark night. And cheer my heart in sorrow; Henceforth myself and all that's mine To Thee, my Savior, I consign, From whom all things I borrow.",

Away with the Arabian gold, With treasures of an earthly mold! I've found a better jewel. My priceless treasure, Lord my God, Is Thy most holy, precious blood, Which flowed from wounds so cruel.",

      "Of death I am no more afraid, New life from Thee is flowing; Thy cross affords me cooling shade When noonday's sun is glowing. When by my grief I am oppressed, On Thee my weary soul shall rest Serenely as on pillows. Thou art my Anchor when by woe My bark is driven to and fro On trouble's surging billows.",
      "And when Thy glory I shall see And taste Thy kingdom's pleasure, Thy blood my royal robe shall be, My joy beyond all measure. When I appear before Thy throne, Thy righteousness shall be my crown- With these I need not hide me. And there, in garments richly wrought As Thine own bride, I shall be brought To stand in joy beside Thee."

      "With might of ours can naught be done, Soon were our loss effected; But for us fights the Valiant One, Whom God Himself elected. Ask ye, Who is this? Jesus Christ it is. Of Sabaoth Lord, And there's none other God; He holds the field forever.",
      "Though devils all the world should fill, All eager to devour us. We tremble not, we fear no ill, They shall not overpower us. This world's prince may still Scowl fierce as he will, He can harm us none, He's judged; the deed is done; One little word can fell him.",
      "The Word they still shall let remain Nor any thanks have for it; He's by our side upon the plain With His good gifts and Spirit. And take they our life, Goods, fame, child and wife, Let these all be gone, They yet have nothing won; The Kingdom ours remaineth."

      "See, the streams of living waters, Springing from Eternal Love, Well supply thy sons and daughters, And all fear of want remove: Who can faint, while such a river Ever will their thirst assuage? Grace, which, like the Lord the Giver, Never fails from age to age.",
      "Round each habitation hov'ring, See the cloud and fire appear, For a glory and a cov'ring: Showing that the Lord is near. Thus deriving from their banner Light by night, and shade by day, Safe they feed upon the manna, Which He gives them on their way.",
      "Savior, if of Zion's city I, through grace, a member am, Let the world deride or pity, I will glory in Thy Name: Fading is the worldling's pleasure, All his boasted pomp and show: Solid joys and lasting treasure None but Zion's children know."

Perishing, perishing! Hark, how they call us; Bring us your Savior, oh, tell us of Him! We are so weary, so heavily laden, And with long weeping our eyes have grown dim.",
      "\"He was not willing that any should perish\"; Am I His follower, and can I live Longer at ease with a soul going downward, Lost for the lack of the help I might give! Perishing, perishing! Thou wast not willing; Master, forgive, and inspire us anew; Banish our worldliness, help us to ever Live with eternity's values in view."

The earth (which represents all of God's promises to His People, Gen 13:14-15, Rom 4:13-17, Mt 5:5) and the water (which represents Baptism and forgiveness, Jn 3:5, Eph 5:25-27, 1Pt 3:21) are frozen and lifeless as the Law reigns alone (2Cor 3:6b), with no grace flowing before Christ. The Spirit (the wind) works in the world through the condemnation of the Law and the hope for redemption to come (frosty wind made moan, Micah 4:10, Ez 21:6-7). Then Christ humbly comes to melt the icy world in grace. This then inspires those saved, who recognize that they have nothing to give to Him, to finally, through His grace, fulfill the greatest commandment (Mt 22:37)."

With twain they veiled their faces, as was meet, With twain in reverent awe they hid their feet, And with the other twain aloft they soared, One to the other called and praised the Lord: \"Holy is God, the Lord of Sabaoth! Holy is God, the Lord of Sabaoth! Holy is God, the Lord of Sabaoth! Behold, His glory filleth all the earth!\" The beams and lintels trembled at the cry, And clouds of smoke enwrapped the throne on high."

      "Should some lust or sharp temptation Prove too strong for flesh and blood, Let me think upon Thy Passion, And the breach is soon made good. Or should Satan press me hard, Let me then be on my guard, Saying, \"Christ for me was wounded,\" That the tempter flee confounded.",
      "If the world my heart entices On the broad and easy road With its mirth and luring vices, Let me think upon the load Thou didst carry and endure That I flee all thoughts impure, Banishing each wild emotion, Calm and blest in my devotion.",
      "Every wound that pains or grieves me, By Thy stripes, Lord, is made whole; When I'm faint, Thy cross revives me, Granting new life to my soul. Yea, Thy comfort renders sweet Every bitter cup I meet; For Thy all atoning Passion Has procured my soul's salvation.",
      "O my God, my Rock and Tower, Grant that in Thy death I trust, Knowing death has lost his power Since Thou trodd'st him in the dust. Savior, let Thine agony Ever help and comfort me; When I die, be my Protection, Light and Life and Resurrection.",
      "Jesus, grant that balm and healing In Thy holy wounds I find, Every hour that I am feeling, Pains of body and of mind. And when I this world must leave, Grant that, Lord, to Thee I cleave, In Thy wounds find consolation And obtain my soul's salvation"

Whose grace and care are endless And saved thee through the past; Who leaves no suff'rer friendless, But rights the wronged at last.",

In Heav'n is fixed His dwelling, His rule is over all; Angels, in might excelling, Bright hosts, before Him fall. Praise Him who ever reigneth, All ye who hear His Word, Nor our poor hymns disdaineth-- My soul, O praise the Lord!"

      "What Thou, my Lord, hast suffered, was all for sinners' gain; Mine, mine was the transgression, but Thine the deadly pain. Lo, here I fall, my Savior! 'Tis I deserve Thy place; Look on me with Thy favor, vouchsafe to me Thy grace.",
      "Men mock and taunt and jeer Thee, Thou noble countenance, Though mighty worlds shall fear Thee and flee before Thy glance. How art thou pale with anguish, with sore abuse and scorn! How doth Thy visage languish that once was bright as morn!",
      "Now from Thy cheeks has vanished their color once so fair; From Thy red lips is banished the splendor that was there. Grim death, with cruel rigor, hath robbed Thee of Thy life; Thus Thou hast lost Thy vigor, Thy strength in this sad strife.",
      "My burden in Thy Passion, Lord, Thou hast borne for me, For it was my transgression which brought this woe on Thee. I cast me down before Thee, wrath were my rightful lot; Have mercy, I implore Thee; Redeemer, spurn me not!",
      "What language shall I borrow to thank Thee, dearest friend, For this Thy dying sorrow, Thy pity without end? O make me Thine forever, and should I fainting be, Lord, let me never, never outlive my love to Thee.",
      "My Shepherd, now receive me; my Guardian, own me Thine. Great blessings Thou didst give me, O source of gifts divine. Thy lips have often fed me with words of truth and love; Thy Spirit oft hath led me to heavenly joys above.",
      "Here I will stand beside Thee, from Thee I will not part; O Savior, do not chide me! When breaks Thy loving heart, When soul and body languish in death's cold, cruel grasp, Then, in Thy deepest anguish, Thee in mine arms I'll clasp.",
      "The joy can never be spoken, above all joys beside, When in Thy body broken I thus with safety hide. O Lord of Life, desiring Thy glory now to see, Beside Thy cross expiring, I'd breathe my soul to Thee.",
      "My Savior, be Thou near me when death is at my door; Then let Thy presence cheer me, forsake me nevermore! When soul and body languish, oh, leave me not alone, But take away mine anguish by virtue of Thine own!",
      "Be Thou my consolation, my shield when I must die; Remind me of Thy passion when my last hour draws nigh. Mine eyes shall then behold Thee, upon Thy cross shall dwell, My heart by faith enfolds Thee. Who dieth thus dies well."

      "Salvation unto us has come By God's free grace and favor; Good works cannot avert our doom, They help and save us never. Faith looks to Jesus Christ alone, Who did for all the world atone; He is our one Redeemer.",
      "What God did in His law demand And none to Him could render Caused wrath and woe on every hand For man, the vile offender. Our flesh has not those pure desires The spirit of the Law requires, And lost is our condition.",
      "It was a false, misleading dream That God His Law had given So sinners could themselves redeem And by their works gain Heaven. The Law is but a mirror bright To bring the inbred sin to light That lurks within our nature.",
      "From sin our flesh could not abstain Sin held its sway unceasing; The task was useless and in vain, Our guilt was e'er increasing. None can remove sin's poisoned dart Or purify our guileful heart? So deep is our corruption.",
      "Yet as the Law must be fulfilled Or we must die despairing, Christ came and hath God's anger stilled, Our human nature sharing. He hath for us the Law obeyed And thus the Father's vengeance stayed Which over us impended.",
      "Since Christ hath full atonement made And brought to us salvation, Each Christian therefore may be glad And build on this foundation. Thy grace alone, dear Lord, I plead, Thy death is now my life indeed, For Thou hast paid my ransom.",
      "Let me not doubt, but trust in Thee, Thy Word cannot be broken; Thy call rings out, \"Come unto Me!\" No falsehood hast Thou spoken. Baptized into Thy precious name, My faith cannot be put to shame, And I shall never perish.",
      "The Law reveals the guilt of sin And makes men conscience-stricken; The Gospel then doth enter in The sinful soul to quicken. Come to the cross, trust Christ, and live; The Law no peace can ever give, No comfort and no blessing.",
      "Faith clings to Jesus' cross alone And rests in Him unceasing; And by its fruits true faith is known, With love and hope increasing. Yet faith alone doth justify, Works serve thy neighbor and supply The proof that faith is living.",
      "All blessing, honor, thanks, and praise To Father, Son, and Spirit, The God that saved us by His grace,- All glory to His merit! O Triune God in heaven above, Who hast revealed Thy saving love, Thy blessed name be hallowed."
