      "Despised and scorned, they sojourned here; But now, how glorious they appear! Those martyrs stand a priestly band, God's throne forever near. So oft, in troubled days gone by, In anguish they would weep and sigh. At home above the God of Love For aye their tears shall dry. They now enjoy their Sabbath rest, The paschal banquet of the blest; The Lamb, their Lord, at festal board Himself is Host and Guest.",
      "Then hail, ye mighty legions, yea, All hail! Now safe and blest for aye, And praise the Lord, who with His Word Sustained you on the way. Ye did the joys of earth disdain, Ye toiled and sowed in tears and pain. Farewell, now bring your sheaves and sing Salvation's glad refrain. Swing high your palms, lift up your song, Yea, make it myriad voices strong. Eternally shall praise to Thee, God, and the Lamb belong."

      "Feasting on the riches of His grace, Resting 'neath His shelt'ring wing, Always looking on His smiling face, That is why I shout and sing. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,-- Sweetest name I know, Fills my ev'ry longing, Keeps me singing as I go.",
      "Though sometimes He leads through waters deep, Trials fall across the way, Though sometimes the path seems rough and steep, See His footprints all the way. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,-- Sweetest name I know, Fills my ev'ry longing, Keeps me singing as I go.",
      "Soon He's coming back to welcome me, Far beyond the starry sky; I shall wing my flight to worlds unknown, I shall reign with Him on high. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,-- Sweetest name I know, Fills my ev'ry longing, Keeps me singing as I go."

Perishing, perishing! Thronging our pathway, Hearts break with burdens too heavy to bear: Jesus would save, but there's no one to tell them, No one to lift them from sin and despair.",

Perishing, perishing! Harvest is passing, Reapers are few and the night draweth near: Jesus is calling thee, haste to the reaping, Thou shalt have souls, precious souls for thy hire.",
      "Plenty for pleasure, but little for Jesus; Time for the world with its troubles and toys, No time for Jesus' work, feeding the hungry, Lifting lost souls to eternity's joys. Perishing, perishing! Hark, how they call us; Bring us your Savior, oh, tell us of Him! We are so weary, so heavily laden, And with long weeping our eyes have grown dim.",
      "\"He was not willing that any should perish\"; Am I His follower, and can I live Longer at ease with a soul going downward, Lost for the lack of the help I might give! Perishing, perishing! Thou wast not willing; Master, forgive, and inspire us anew; Banish our worldliness, help us to ever Live with eternity's values in view."

The earth (which represents all of God's promises to His People, Gen 13:14-15, Rom 4:13-17, Mt 5:5) and the water (which represents Baptism and forgiveness, Jn 3:5, Eph 5:25-27, 1Pt 3:21) are frozen and lifeless as the Law reigns alone (2Cor 3:6b), with no grace flowing before Christ. The Spirit (the wind) works in the world through the condemnation of the Law and the hope for redemption to come (frosty wind made moan, Micah 4:10, Ez 21:6-7). Then Christ humbly comes to melt the icy world in grace. This then inspires those saved, who recognize that they have nothing to give to Him, to finally, through His grace, fulfill the greatest commandment (Mt 22:37)."

The gain of this one thing all loss can requite And teach me in all things to find true delight.",

Seek not midst created things; What is earthly, leave behind thee, over nature stretch thy wings; For where God and man both in One are united, With God's perfect fullness the heart is delighted; There, there is the worthiest lot and the best, My One and my All, and my Joy, and my Rest.",

      "Wisdom's highest noblest treasure, Jesus, lies conceal'd in Thee; Grant that this may still the measure Of my will and actions be: Humility there and simplicity reigning, My steps shall in wisdom for ever be training; Oh! if I of Christ have this knowledge divine, The fullness of heavenly wisdom is mine.",
      "Christ, Thou art the sole oblation That I'll bring before my God; In his sight I've acceptation Only through Thy streaming blood: Immaculate righteousness now I've acquired, Since Thou on the tree of the cross hast expired; The robe of salvation for ever is mine, In this shall my faith through eternity shine.",

Grace o'erwhelms me with its flood; Thou, my Savior, once hast enter'd Holiest heaven through Thy blood: Eternal redemption for sinners there finding, From hell's dark dominion my spirit unbinding, To me perfect freedom Thy entrance has brought, And childlike to cry, \"Abba, Father,\" I'm taught.",
      "Christ Himself, my Shepherd, feeds me, Peace and joy my spirit fill; In a pasture green He leads me Forth beside the waters still: Oh! naught to my soul is so sweet and reviving, As thus unto Jesus alone to be living; True happiness this, and this only supplies, Through faith on my Savior to fasten my eyes.",
      "Therefore, Jesus, my Salvation, Thou my One, my All shalt be; Prove my fix'd determination, Root out all hypocrisy: Look well if on sin's slippery paths I am hasting, And lead me, O Lord, in the way everlasting; This one thing is needful, all others are vain, I count all but loss that I Christ may obtain."

No more be weak, no more feel faint.",
      "They sigh no more, gone are their fears, No crying make, shed no more tears; They grow not old, sense no more loss, Gone are their doubts and all their dross. There'll be no sin and no more stain, Unknown is sickness, gone is pain; The death of death, no more the hearse, The end of grief, the end of curse. The end of grief, the end of curse.\"",
      "These words are spoken faithfully, Alpha, Omega, Lord is He; For all is done and done for all, For all who come, for all who call. Come see His face, His hands, His feet, Come quench your thirst, partake the Feast, Come enter in while still you may, Then Jesus bring Eternal Day. Then Jesus bring Eternal Day."

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross, Till my trophies at last I lay down; I will cling to the old rugged cross, And exchange it some day for a crown.",

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross, Till my trophies at last I lay down; I will cling to the old rugged cross, And exchange it some day for a crown.",

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross, Till my trophies at last I lay down; I will cling to the old rugged cross, And exchange it some day for a crown."
